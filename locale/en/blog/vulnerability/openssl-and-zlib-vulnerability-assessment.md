## Summary

The vulnerability in the OpenSSL Security release of Oct 11 2022 does not affect any active Node.js release lines, as well
as the zlib vulnerability ([CVE-2022-37434][]) patched on the zlib Security release of Oct 13 2022, does not affect Node.js.

## Analysis OpenSSL

Our assessment of the [security advisory](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-October/000236.html) is:

### Using a Custom Cipher with `NID_undef` may lead to NULL encryption (CVE-2022-3358)

Node.js doesn't call `EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(NID_undef, ...)`. Therefore, Node.js is not affected by this vulnerability.

## Analysis zlib

Our assessment of the [CVE-2022-37434][] is:

### Buffer overflow in inflate via a large gzip header extra field

Node.js doesn't call `inflateGetHeader`. Therefore, Node.js is not affected by this vulnerability.

Further information, see: [nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments#50][].

## Node.js Vulnerability Assessment workflow

The Node.js Security team created an automated workflow that aims to address all the public CVE of Node.js dependencies.

This initiative aims to reduce the gap between a dependency security release and a Node.js assessment.
The repository is available at [nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments][], and the assessments are made through the
issues.

Ensure to watch the repository if you are interested in security patches.

### Contact and future updates

The current Node.js security policy can be found at <https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/SECURITY.md#security>,
including information on how to report a vulnerability in Node.js.
