## Summary

The vulnerability in the OpenSSL Security Advisory of Dec 13 2022 do not affect any active Node.js release lines.

## Analysis

Our assessment of the [security advisory](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-December/000246.html) is:

### X.509 Policy Constraints Double Locking (CVE-2022-3996)

Node.js doesn't call OpenSSL as a separate process (so the possibility to use the `-policy` flag is invalid), nor call
the functions `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy()` and `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()`.
Therefore, Node.js is not affected by this vulnerability.
