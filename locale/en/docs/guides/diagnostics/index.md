# Diagnostics Guide

These guides were created by the [Diagnostics Working Group][] with the
objective of providing guidance when diagnosing an issue in a user's
application.

The documentation project is organized based on user journey. Those journeys
are a coherent set of step-by-step procedures that a user can follow to
root-cause their issues.

This is the available set of diagnostics guides:

* [Memory](/en/docs/guides/diagnostics/memory)
* [Live Debugging](/en/docs/guides/diagnostics/live-debugging)
* [Poor Performance](/en/docs/guides/diagnostics/poor-performance)
